2. **Add Conference Room**: Provides a form to add a new conference room. You can choose the type of room, associated department, date, start time, end time, location, and maximum duration.
3. **Edit Conference Room**: Allows you to edit the details of an existing conference room.
4. **Delete Conference Room**: Lets you delete a conference room from the list.

## Prerequisites

These libraries are already imported via CDNs in the provided code.

## Setup

1. Save the provided HTML content to a file named `index.html`.
